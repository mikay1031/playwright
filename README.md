# playwright
This is a repo for my latest playwright automation learning. This includes sample e2e automation test, API tests and some activities on tips in playwright. 


To run the whole test, just envoke this on your terminal:

npx playwright test --config=playwright.config.ts --project=Chromium --retries=2
